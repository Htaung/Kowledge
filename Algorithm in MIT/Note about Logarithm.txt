A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised in order to get some other number 
(see Section 3 of this Math Review for more about exponents). 
For example, the base ten logarithm of 100 is 2, because ten raised to the power of two is 100:

log 100 = 2

because

10 to the power 2  = 100
